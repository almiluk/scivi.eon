# scivi.eon

Embedded reasoner for task ontologies in EON format allowing ontology-based Edge Computing within SciVi, part of SciVi.Tools project

## EON format

EON (stands for Embedded or Edge ONtology) is a binary format for storing task ontologies right on the resource-constrained Edge devices. Saving ontologies in EON format assumes spacial "cognitive compression" algorithm, that ensures high compression ratio to fit meaningful task ontology in several bytes.
ONT (ONTOLIS ontology format) to EON converter is implemented in [SciVi.Web](https://github.com/scivi-tools/scivi.web) server.

## Demo

Reproducable example and detailed instruction are coming soon.
