# scivi.eon

Embedded reasoner for task ontologies in EON format allowing ontology-based Edge Computing within SciVi, part of SciVi.Tools project

## EON format

EON (stands for Embedded or Edge ONtology) is a binary format for storing task ontologies right on the resource-constrained Edge devices. Saving ontologies in EON format assumes spacial "cognitive compression" algorithm, that ensures high compression ratio to fit meaningful task ontology in several bytes.
ONT (ONTOLIS ontology format) to EON converter is implemented in [SciVi.Web](https://github.com/scivi-tools/scivi.web) server.

## EON reasoner

The main feature of EON is its "reasonability", which means the task ontology can actually be interpreted on the Edge device governing its behavior. This repo includes the skeleton of the reasoning firmware to be installed on the MCU of Edge device. The full installable firmware is generated by SciVi according to the users' preferences about what functions should be available on the ontology level.

## Demo

Reproducable example and detailed instruction are coming soon.
